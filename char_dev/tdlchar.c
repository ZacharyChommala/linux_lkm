 * @version 1.0
 * @brief   An introductory character driver Linux loadable kernel module (LDM)
 * This module maps to /dev/tdlchar and comes with a helper C program that can be
 * run in Linux user space to communicate with this the LKM.
 *
 * This code is based on the tdlchar.c code written by Derek Molloy
 * @see http://www.derekmolloy.ie/ for a full description and follow-up descriptions.

// WARNINGS:
// --------
// The simple code here is inadequate for serious driver use in a couple important ways:
// 1) Fixed buffer size - can be fixed with appropriate dynamic allocation of memory
// 2) Not multi-process/multi-thread safe - can be fixed with appropriate use of mutex

#include <linux/init.h>           // Macros used to mark up functions e.g. __init __exit
#include <linux/module.h>         // Core header for loading LKMs into the kernel
#include <linux/device.h>         // Header to support the kernel Driver Model
#include <linux/kernel.h>         // Contains types, macros, functions for the kernel, sprintf()
#include <linux/fs.h>             // Header for the Linux file system support
